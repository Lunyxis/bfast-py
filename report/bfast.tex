\section{BFAST}
\label{sec:bfast}

%% in which the BFAST approach differs from the similar methods is that it uses the
%% OLS-MOSUM statistical test to determine whether the breakpoints are taking place in the seasonal and
%% trend components of the time series before committing to the costly
%% dynamic-programming algorithm that determines the location and quality of the
%% breakpoints. In the R implementation, Verbeselt et al.\cite{bfast-github} use
%% the \texttt{strucchange} package, originally by Zelis et. al \cite{strucchange}.
